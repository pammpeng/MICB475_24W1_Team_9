# Agenda Items

## Alpha Beta Diversity
- Alpha: All metrics except simpsons-> Asthma lowest diversity, MS, MS + asthma, healthy has similar higheset diversity
- Beta: only significant differences in healthy vs MS (p=0.006)
- significant differences in evenness

## Core microbiome: 
- control group has the most unique ASVs
- highest degree of overlap in composition between MS and MS_Asthma
- control vs MS has the same overlap as control vs asthma
- MS_Asthma vs Control = 62%
- Asthma vs Control = 71%
- MS vs Control = 71%
- MS vs MS_asthma = 78%
- **overall MS masks the effects of asthma but asthma still plays a role?**

## DESEQ
- MS vs Control: 15 decrease, 8 increase
- Asthma vs Control: 27 decrease, 6 increase
- MS+Asthma vs Control: 19 decrease, 9 increase
- MS+Asthma vs MS: 13 decrease, 10 increase
- MS+Asthma vs Asthma: 5 decrease, 18 increase
- MS vs Asthma: 8 decrease, 19 increase
- Perform lit search to investigate role of specific genera?

## ALDEx2
- Blautia more abundant in asthma vs control group, but less abundant in MS vs Asthma and MS+Asthma vs Asthma
- Romboutsia is even less abundant in MS+Asthma vs Asthma compared to MS vs Control and MS+Asthma vs Control
- No graph generated for MS_asthma_vs_MS as there were no genera that were significantly different between the two groups

## Picrust2
- MS_Asthma is most clustered, does that mean they are more similar? less diverse?

## Hypothetical Narrative
- Ms_Asthma vs MS =similar, MS masks the effects of asthma.
