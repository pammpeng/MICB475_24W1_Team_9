# Agenda Items

## Alpha Beta Diversity
- Alpha: All metrics except simpsons-> Asthma lowest diversity, MS, MS + asthma, healthy has similar higheset diversity
- Beta: only significant differences in healthy vs MS (p=0.006)
- significant differences in evenness

## Core microbiome: 
- control group has the most unique ASVs
- highest degree of overlap in composition between MS and MS_Asthma
- control vs MS has the same overlap as control vs asthma
- MS_Asthma vs Control = 62%
- Asthma vs Control = 71%
- MS vs Control = 71%
- MS vs MS_asthma = 78%
- **overall MS masks the effects of asthma but asthma still plays a role?**

## DESEQ
- **asthma/MS vs MS 11 up 11 down. had greatest difference in up/down regulated genes.**
- **Asthma vs Control 3 up 17 down. has a big difference**
- MS vs Control 10 up 10 down
- Asthma_MS vs Control 9 up 11 down
- **Asthma vs MS 4 up 16 down**
- Look at the role of specific genera to see in literature
- Annie having difficulty with ANCOM, needs assistance, will send Hans her code

## Picrust2
- MS_Asthma is most clustered, does that mean they are more similar? less diverse?
