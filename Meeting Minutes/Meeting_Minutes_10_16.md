## Agenda Items
- Review proposed research aims
    1. Investigative comparison of variables composition (alpha and beta diversity, what are the significant differences, functional consequences?) of healthy people as control vs asthma
    2. Investigative comparison of variables functionality from first aim
    3. Explore further variables (socioeconomic status, education, genetics ms_family) as final figure
- Discuss preliminary data analysis on societal factors 
    - p-value of 0.07 between control and MS population for social variables (education and occupation)
        - is it worth keeping as an aim?
    - no significance between asthma and mode of delivery 
        - could potentially look at microbiome composition?
        - possible new aim of microbiome chnages in patients based on mode of delivery and prevalence of asthma and MS
    - very significant association between sexes 
- Metadata Update 
    - right now our metadata has 22 variables (including sample ID) and 152 samples 
- Manifest file progress: able to use the ms_manifest.tsv file from project_2 directory on class server. Is this okay?
- Help with Proposed approach
