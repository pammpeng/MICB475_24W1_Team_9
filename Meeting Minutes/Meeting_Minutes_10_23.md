- Research aims:
    1. Investigate Alpha and Beta Diversity in the Gut Microbiome of MS patients with and without Asthma
    2. Identify Differentially Abundant Microbial Taxa Using DESeq2 Analysis and Core Microbiome Identification
          analysis. Hans: Log Ratio is a better approach; Ancom and Aldex2 tools, plug ins into QIIME2
    3. Conduct Functional Analysis to Explore Microbial Metabolic Pathways using PICRUSt2
       - Module 17: PICRUSt2 as a resource, use internet, look at previous MICB475 GitHub codes just reference it
- Proposal debrief
    - What went well?
    - What could be improved for next time?
- Tasks already completed
    1. QIIME2 Processing
- To-do for October 29th
    1. Alpha and Beta diversity analysis
    2. Taxonomic analysis-> requires literature search
    - Start this analysis this week ideally so it is ready.
    - Tip: Start writing results and methods as we go 
- Assign roles
