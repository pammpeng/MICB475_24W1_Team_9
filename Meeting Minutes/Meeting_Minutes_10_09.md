## Agenda Items
- Research question: Is the microbiome a mediator of the increased prevalence of asthma in patients with MS compared to the general public?
    - More specific question: Determine whether the microbiota differs in RRMS and PMS patients with and without asthma.
- Metadata discussion
    - Variables retained: sample-id, site_x, sex, age, year_of_onset, disease, disease_course,                disease_duration, diet_no_special_needs, diet_special_needs, birth_method, breastfeeding,               allergies, allergy_specific, asthma, eczema, ms_family, nsaids, nsaids_specifics, rxmeds,               rxmeds_number, otc_meds, otc_number, smoke
    - Are there any variables missing that would be valuable for our analysis?
          - We haven't included MS treatment variables
    - Are there any variables retained that are not important for the analysis?
    - Concerns: how do we control for confounding variables?
 - MS prevalence
    - 76% RRMS (437/576)
    - PMS: 12% SPMS (68/576) + 12% PPMS (71/576)
    - All MS patients with asthma have RRMS - should we filter out patients with PMS?
- Sample sizes for each group:
    - RRMS + Asthma: 40
    - RRMS + no asthma: 40
    - no MS + no asthma: 40
    - We haven't randomly sampled yet
- Make the manifest file - TA assistance? 
- Filter the metadata in R once variables are confirmed
