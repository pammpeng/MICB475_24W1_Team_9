## Agenda Items
- Research question: Is the microbiome a mediator of the increased prevalence of asthma in patients with MS compared to the general public?
    - More specific question: Determine whether the microbiota differs in RRMS and PMS patients with and without asthma.
- Metadata discussion
    - Variables retained: 
    - Are there any variables missing that would be valuable for our analysis?
    - Are there any variables retained that are not important for the analysis?
    - Concerns: how do we control for confounding variables?
 - Asthma prevalence
    - Look at asthma prevalence in RRMS and PMS
    - 76% RRMS (437/576)
    - PMS: 12% SPMS (68/576) + 12% PPMS (71/576)
    - Since all patients with MS and asthma have RRMS, should we filter out patients with PMS?
- Sample sizes for each group:
    - RRMS + Asthma: 40
    - RRMS + no asthma: 40
    - no MS + no asthma: 40
    - We haven't randomly sampled yet
- Make the manifest file - TA assistance? 
- Filter the metadata in R once variables are confirmed
