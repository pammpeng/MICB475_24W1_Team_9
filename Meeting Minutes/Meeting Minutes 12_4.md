- feedback on final narrative/title
## Notes on Story
- core microbiome and diversity metrics there isn't a difference in diveristy between the two groups
- DeSeq doesn't align with this - MS and asthma alone reduce a lot of genra, add MS to asthma restores some of the genera 
- Picrust didn't get much
- MS is restoring diversity, seen also in the DeSeq
- presenting the DeSeq as a ratio of increase to decrease
- MS seems to have a restoring effect on the decrease caused by asthma 
 - discussion the contriditing evidence in the discussion section
 - we are leading towards the side that there is no influence on the microbiome
 - can still discussion the shared genera
 - still discussion the pie crust, there is also no functional differences 
 - diseases effect the microbiome in different ways
 - could be balancing each other out with functional redundency
 - ## there is not an effect on the microbiome
 - Pam gets to include her PcoA plot!!!!!! (cause it shows there is nothing)
 - move the table to sup and put figure 4 as PcoA plot
